;;; # Expander module
;;;
;;; The parse tree needs to be expanded into an abstract syntax tree before it
;;; can be further processed. In the expansion process, keywords/syntactic
;;; keywords (macros) are invoked until the result reaches a core form.
;;;
;;; The expansion process is as follows:
;;;
;;; * macro use: The associated transformer is invoked, then the resulting form
;;;   is run through the expander again.
;;; * define-syntax form: The right-hand-side is evaluated into a transformer
;;;   and bound to the keyword.
;;; * define form: The identifier is marked as a variable, but the expansion of
;;;   its right-hand-side is deferred.
;;; * begin form: The subforms are spliced into the list of body forms it is
;;;   processing.
;;; * let-syntax or letrec-syntax form: Its inner body is spliced into the list
;;;   of (outer) body forms it is processing, arranging for the keywords bound
;;;   to be visible only in the inner body forms.
;;; * expression, i.e., nondefinition: The expression is expanded, then the
;;;   deferred right-hand-side expressions are expanded. The remaining
;;;   expressions in the body are expanded and an equivalent of a letrec* is
;;;   formed from the defined variables, expanded right-hand-side expressions
;;;   and expanded body expressions.
;;;
;;; ## Top-level body
;;;
;;; The expansion of a top-level body behaves mostly as described above with
;;; the following exceptions:
;;;
;;; * nondefinition: Its expansion is deferred and the expander continues with
;;;   the rest of the items.
;;; * once the end is reached: The deferred right-hand-side and body
;;;   expressions are expanded and the equivalent of a letrec* is formed from
;;;   the defined variables, expanded right-hand-side expressions, and expanded
;;;   body expressions. For each expression that appears before a variable
;;;   definition, a dummy binding is created at the corresponding place within
;;;   the set of letrec* bindings, with a fresh temporary variable on the
;;;   left-hand side and the equivalent of (begin <expression> <unspecified>).
